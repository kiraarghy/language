# New programming language

This project is to implement a new programming language in typescript. It sorta follows a javascript like pattern in its code execution.

I'm doing this at the suggestion of my wonderful girlfriend @somehats as a manner of improving and levelling up my skills as a programmer.

Mostly it's for fun and should be a heck of a lot easier than implementing lisp as I tried to do in [reason](https://github.com/kiraarghy/Reason-Native-Lisp-Interpreter) which was a lot.

Follow my thoughts as I write it [here](https://github.com/kiraarghy/language/blob/master/As_I_go.md).
