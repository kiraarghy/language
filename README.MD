# New programming language

This project is to implement a new programming language in javascript. It sorta follows a javascript like pattern in its code execution.

I'm doing this at the suggestion of my wonderful girlfriend @somehats as a manner of improving and levelling up my skills as a programmer.

Mostly it's for fun and should be a heck of a lot easier than implementing lisp as I tried to do in [reason](https://github.com/kiraarghy/Reason-Native-Lisp-Interpreter) which was a lot.
